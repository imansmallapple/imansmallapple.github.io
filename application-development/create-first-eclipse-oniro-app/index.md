## Before you begin  

Make sure you have gone through the [environment setup guide](/application-development/environment-setup-config/).  

<!--  -->
In this tutorial, you will create your first Eclipse Oniro application with `OpenHarmony` template provided by `DevEco Studio`. 

#### Prerequisites
- Current available version of DevEco Studio installed on your system

#### What you will learn  
- **Set up DevEco Studio**: Installed and configured the necessary environment for application development.
<br>

- **Created a new project**: Used the `[openHarmony]Empty Ability` template to initialize a project.
<br>

- **Explored the project structure**: Navigated different views like Ohos and Project Files to locate and manage files.
<br>

- **Used the Previewer**: Learned how to preview UI updates in real time, switch devices, rotate screens, and inspect components.
<br>

- **Built UI components**: Added Text and Button components to display messages and handle user interactions.
<br>

- **Implemented page navigation**: Used the router module to enable redirection between pages with transition effects.
<br>

- **Deployed on a real device**: Installed HDC, configured device settings, and ran the application on a physical HiHope HH-SCDAYU200 Development Kit.
<br>


#### What you will build
- An application with two pages that support mutual navigation.
