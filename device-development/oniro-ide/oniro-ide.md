# Oniro IDE
Oniro IDE is an [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org/) based IDE for the Oniro operating system. It allows developers to build applications for a wide range of smart devices in what is called "one-time development". One code can adapt to multiple devices, improving development efficiency and implementing cross-end service ecosystem sharing.

Here we provide a quick guide to various IDE features and what is expected to come in the future.
