# HiHope HH-SCDAYU200 Development Kit

Text from [here](https://github.com/eclipse-oniro4openharmony/eclipse-oniro4openharmony.github.io/blob/main/developer-boards/hihope-hh-scdayu200.md)

## Introduction
Based on the Rockchip RK3568, this development kit integrates advanced features
such as a dual-core architecture GPU and a high-performance NPU. Complemented by 
an onboard quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A55 processor which has a frequency of up to 2.0GHz, 
it ensures robust performance.

The rich set of peripherals ranges from Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to audio, video,
camera and a variety of Bosch Sensortec sensors.

The expansion board offers rich expansion interfaces, and supports a variety
of video input and output interfaces suited for applications with rich user
interface requirements.

It is also equipped with dual Gigabit adaptive RJ45 Ethernet ports, which can
meet the needs of NVR, industrial gateway and other multi-network port products.

## Building

To build Eclipse Oniro for this board the normal [quick build](../../quick-build-with-oniro)
procedure has to be used to fetch the needed source code and environment.

During the build step, inside the Docker instance, the target device for the
build has to be set to **rk3568**.

```bash
./build.sh --product-name rk3568 --ccache
```

## Flashing

To begin, connect the board to your computer as outlined in [the HiHope DAYU200 documentation](https://gitee.com/hihope_iot/docs/blob/master/HiHope_DAYU200/docs/%E7%83%A7%E5%BD%95%E6%8C%87%E5%AF%BC%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3.md). Use the USB-C and mini-USB cables included in the kit to connect to the USB 3.0 OTG port and the mini-USB DEBUG port, respectively.

Power on the device by attaching the power cable. Upon successful connection, your serial console should display output similar to:

```bash
Bus 002 Device 009: ID 2207:5000 Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Company "HDC Device"
...
Bus 001 Device 069: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 Serial (UART) IC
```

Download the `flash.py` flashing tool from [Gitee](https://gitee.com/hihope_iot/docs/tree/master/HiHope_DAYU200/%E7%83%A7%E5%86%99%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%E5%8F%8A%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97/linux) using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/hihope_iot/docs.git hihope_iot_docs
mkdir flash && cp -r hihope_iot_docs/HiHope_DAYU200/烧写工具及指南/linux/* flash/
chmod +x flash/flash.py flash/bin/flash.x86_64
```

To ensure proper device recognition, install the `udev` rule:

```bash
sudo cp flash/etc/udev/rules.d/85-rk3568.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/85-rk3568.rules
```
Then, either reload udev rules or reboot your system:

```bash
udevadm control --reload-rules
````

After this setup, running `flash/flash.py -q` should produce the following output, indicating readiness:

```bash
maskrom
```

To enable *programming mode* on the device, perform the following steps:

 1. Press and hold `VOL/RECOVERY` then `RESET` buttons.
 2. Release `RESET` button.

Confirm the mode by running `lsusb`, which should show:

```bash
...
Bus 001 Device 070: ID 2207:350a Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Company USB download gadget
...

$ flash/flash.py -q
loader
```

Once the above steps are completed successfully, you can proceed to flash the board:

```bash
flash/flash.py -a -i ./out/rk3568/packages/phone/images
```

### Connecting to serial console

To read the serial output, ensure the board is correctly connected and powered on. The default baud rate for the HH-SCDAYU200 board is 1500000. You can use minicom or a similar serial terminal:

```bash
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000
```
