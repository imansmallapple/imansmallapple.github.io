This section delves into the specifics of Eclipse Oniro's supported developer boards. 'Supported' here means being in active use by its developers and being part of the CI/CD pipeline that guards the development processes.

Given Eclipse Oniro is based on OpenHarmony, a way broader set of hardware support is available in the codebase. The only reason the other devices are not listedhere, is the missing active use and CI/CD testing.
