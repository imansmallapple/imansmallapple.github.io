Text from [here](https://github.com/eclipse-oniro4openharmony/eclipse-oniro4openharmony.github.io/blob/main/developer-boards/index.md)  

This section delves into the specifics of Eclipse Oniro's supported developer boards. 'Supported' here means being in active use by its developers and being part of the CI/CD pipeline that guards the development processes.

Currently this only cover the [HiHope SCDAYU200 development board](./hihope_hh-scdayu200).
Given Eclipse Oniro is based on OpenHarmony, a way broader set of hardware support is available in the codebase. The only reason the other devices are not listedhere, is the missing active use and CI/CD testing.
